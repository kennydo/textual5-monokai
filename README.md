textual5-monokai
================
This is a Monokai theme for Textual 5.

It is based on the [Simplified Dark theme](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual/tree/master/Resources/Styles/Styles/Simplified%20Dark) bundled with Textual 5, with additional modifications based on the [Textual 4 Monokai theme](https://github.com/bettin/textual-monokai) and the [Atom Monokai theme](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai).

# Installation

To install:
```bash
$ ~/Library/Group Containers/8482Q6EPL6.com.codeux.irc.textual/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles
$ git clone https://github.com/kennydo/textual5-monokai
```

And then select *textual5-monokai* under *Preferences* -> *Appearance* -> *Channel View*.

Note that symlinking to the checked out theme seems to be unsupported, so don't do that.
